# Project Repository: Whendor

## Description
Whendor is a web app designed to increase the reach that street vendors have. Whendor doesn't just take food vendors into account, it makes sure that all types of street vendors have a voice. Street vendors will be able to create a profile where they can post their location, business hours, contact information, and photos about their products. Once a profile is created, it will be available for customers to view and decide they'd like to buy from a vendor. Customers are able to create an account and then browse for vendors by category (the type of product that a vendor sells).

## History
NYC is a rich and prosperous city that offers almost anything to consumers; multiple shops, restaurants, and department stores are within walking distance from a buyer. Oftentimes, street vendors are overlooked and taken for granted. Some of these street vendors are the true hidden gems of NYC â€” offering great products for a cheap price. Street vendors are also extremely hard working, it takes courage to go out and sell on the street, and they deserve more than what they get.
